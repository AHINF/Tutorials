# Tutorials

Hi there and welcome to the GitHub repository of [Java Tutorial Network](https://javatutorial.net). Here you will find the source codes of the examples posted on the site.

Please note: Java is a great and vast programming language and you should strive to write your code in the best way you can, using comments, proper exception handling, object oriented principles and design patterns. Having said this, the examples on https://javatutorial.net and the code you will find here are not always perfect. You may find short codes, with missing exception handling. Please have in mind, we do this on purpose. As strange this may sound, we try to keep the examples short and easy to follow and sometimes sacrifice the exception handling and other object oriented principles.

You can use the code in this repository to complete all your development tasks - no matter if you are writing a open-source project or a commercial software. I believe knowledge is not a privilege and should be shared without affording payment for it. Use the code as you like. 

I will be happy if you spread the word and post a link to javatutorial.net in your projects, so other people can also benefit from free knowledge.

Thank you!
